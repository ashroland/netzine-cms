			<h1>hey, a quick warning.</h1>
			<p>this net zine deals with a lot of heavy material, mostly centered around one person's experience with the early stages of transition. these are sort of tumultuous times and i need a vent space.</p>
			<p>while my relationship to transition is an evolving dialogue, the pages herein contain a lot of content about or alluding to bodies, gender, transphobia, depression, anxiety, prescription drugs, isolation, suicide, murder, alcohol, and tobacco, and possibly plenty of others that aren't yet on my radar.</p>

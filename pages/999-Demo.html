		<h1>Hello!</h1>

		<p><b>netzine-cms</b> is an experimental content management system of reasonable design defaults, dreamt for use in creative academic contexts.</p>

		<p>It assumes that its users are already busy authoring their next brilliant metatextual opus, and don't want to be bothered with writing code for common navigation tasks. It aims to be unobtrusive, lightweight, and as drop-in-place as possible. It provides a self-populating menu (see bottom right) and assumes some decent default behaviors for handling common file types.</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><a href=""><b>Download netzine-cms</b></a> and place it on your web server.</li>
			<li>Place files into the <em>pages</em> directory.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That's it!</p>

		<h3>Supported Filetypes</h3>
		<p>netzine-cms currently has handlers written for common web formats (.html, .php), most major image formats (.jpg, .gif, .png, and others), as well as most common programming formats (.js, .py, .rb, ...).</p>

		<p>to see how netzine-cms handles different filetypes, check out the demos in the menu.</p>

		<h3>Planned Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>assume subdirectories in ./pages are chapters and provide chapternav</li>
			<li>module for common audio formats</li>
		</ul>

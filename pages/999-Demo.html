		<h1>Hello!</h1>

		<p><b>netzine-cms</b> is an experimental content management system of reasonable design defaults, dreamt for use in creative academic contexts.</p>

		<p>It assumes that its users are already busy authoring their next brilliant metatextual opus, and don't want to be bothered with writing code for common navigation tasks. It aims to be unobtrusive, lightweight, and as drop-in-place as possible. It provides a self-populating menu (see bottom right), as well as lucid default behaviors for handling common file types.</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/ashroland/netzine-cms/archive/master.zip"><b>Download netzine-cms</b></a> and place it on your web server.</li>
			<li>Place your files into the <em>pages</em> directory.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That's it!</p>

		<h3>Philosophy</h3>
		<p>traditional zine-making is democratized book-binding with 
			commonly available office supplies. netzine-cms aims to be the printer paper 
			and staples of online zine publishing. it joins several different tools 
			together as design decisions to make publishing as simple as dropping 
			files on a server.</p>

		<h4>What it is</h4>
		<p>a lightweight framework which provides pagination for many different 
			filetypes. an organizational system. a form of collage. sensible design 
			decisions. accessible.</p>

		<h4>What it isn't</h4>
		<p>netzine-cms assumes you already know how to author a webpage so it 
			provides no tools for generating semantic markdown. bloated. </p>

		<h4>Accessibility and Durability</h4>
		<p>whenever possible, netzine-cms makes an effort to output semantically-valid,
			user-parseable and machine-traversable HTML. it is designed to work well with
			screenreaders. it is built to be very static for archive projects 
			like <a href="https://archive.org/web">the internet archive</a>.</p>

		<h3>Supported Filetypes</h3>
		<p>netzine-cms currently has handlers written for common web formats (.html, .php), most major image formats (.jpg, .gif, .png, and others), as well as most common programming formats (.js, .py, .rb, ...).</p>

		<p>to see how netzine-cms handles different filetypes, check out the demos in the menu.</p>

		<h3>Planned Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>assume subdirectories in ./pages are chapters and provide chapternav</li>
			<li>module for common audio formats</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Author</h3>
		<p>This project is developed and maintained by <a href="https://ashro.land">Ash Roland</a></p>.
